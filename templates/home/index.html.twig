        <p class="block-text-home">Since 1988, our passionate troupe has been working to offer
            a show that you do not even suspect exists. If you are tired
            of seeing the same shows, then this is the place for you.
            Arsonists who will show you the depths of hell, ventriloquists who
            do not need anyone to speak, cute clowns whose smile will fill you with joy,
            magicians who make your children disappear for a quiet evening ...
            You will understand, it is not a circus like the others.
            Are you ready for the last attraction of your life?
            Will you rise to this challenge? MOUUUHAHHAHAH !!!!</p>
